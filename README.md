# The Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
### Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

## Overview of Project
  ### Purpose and Backround
    This project revolved around us sorting through excel data and finding trends about Kickstarter campaigns. The goal is to help to an up and coming playright make informed decisions prior to making their own Kickstarter campaign. This data will help them make decisons that will give them the greatest chance of successfully getting the funding they need. 

## Anaylsis and Challenges 
  ### Overview of Anaylsis 
    We looked at data from previous Kickstarter campaigns including their goals, pledged amounts, whether they succeded or failed, months launched, and years involved. There were other pieces of data that were analyzed but they didnt have as much of an impact on our conclusions. We did look for trends in catagory statistcs, subcatagory statistics, statistics based on the launch dat, and outcomes based on the goals the kickstarters had when they were created. 
  ### Challenges involved
    I ran into challenges throughout this assignment when trying to refference specific cells or columns that were on different sheets. I ran into this issue especially on the last two activities. I managed to get the data relating to launch date to reference the cells from the main page eventually but for some reason I couldnt do the same on the sheet pertanting to the outcomes based on goals. I ended up having to apply certain filters on the main sheet and then copy and paste the relevent columns from the sheet onto the new sheet. This allowed the cells to reference cells on the same sheet and it worked fine. It isnt ideal but I think with practice I will learn to do it correctly. 
  
## Results
  ### Launch Date Conclusions
    Data was pulled from the excel sheet to find trends specific to the theater catagory. The first of these sets of data was to try and find a correlation between the months people launched their campaigns and the success rates of those kickstarters. When looking at the data there is a clear uptick in the amount of successfully launched theater kickstarters beginning in April and peaking in May. After May there is a steady decline in the number of successful theater related Kickstarters. Based on the chart it would be a good idea for an individual to try to launch their theater related kickstarter in May or April to give it the best chance of success. 
    
  ### Outcomes based on goals
    The next data set that was looked at was to determine whether there is a correlation between the amount of funding theater related kickstarters were asking for and their success and failure rates. It was found that theater related kickstarters asking for less than a 1000 dollars and kickstarters asking for between 1000 and 4999 dollars had the greatest success rates compared to the rest of the kickstarters. There is a steep decline in success rates when funding goals were greater than 4999 dollars. 
  ### Limitations of this dataset
    There are several limitions of the data we collected and looked at. The first and largest being that this data does not represent the last several years and thus could show different trends or correlations if the data was more recent. This data also does not represent every single kickstarter ever created, this data was specifically filtered to give us data that was only related to one specific catagory of kickstarter. The overall data of all kickstarters would most likley show very different trends.
